## Synopsis

This program downloads all photos and videos from a user without the official API. All files are saved into a folder of the specified username in the same directory as instagram_downloader.py

Your username and password are optional, but they allow you to download private profiles that you follow photos and videos also.

NEW: For a version with GUI support, use the 'GUI' branch. More info is on the README for that branch.

## Usage
```
instagram_downloader.py -u 'your username' -p 'your password' -d 'username 1' 'username 2' 'username n'
```
